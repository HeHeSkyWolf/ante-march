# Cyber History: AnTe March

Language: [EN](./README.md) / [CN](./README_CN.md)

## Project Background

SiriusWiki presents information about the game "AnTe March"(安特进行曲), developed by **上海AWT工作室**, with [**7k7k小游戏**](#reference) as one of its publishers.
In this encyclopedia, I've gathered index links for the game's bosses, vehicles, NPCs, and monsters that I could find online. I hope you enjoy it.

I started this project to archive and commemorate a web-based game from my childhood. The game's servers have been officially shut down, and its content will soon be lost in the vast ocean of data on the Internet.
This project aims to **archive and commemorate** the web game "AnTe March", which officially shut down its servers in 2015.

Note that this encyclopedia is in Chinese only.
